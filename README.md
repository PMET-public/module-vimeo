# Description

When a product media gallery includes a vimeo video, this module will add some additional functionality to the gallery.
- Auto play the video after the gallery has finished loaded if the video is the first item in the gallery.
- Skip to the next item in the gallery after the video has finished playing for the first time.
- Display the video iframe with fixed height/width at each break point to remove any black bars.

# Usage Instructions

- Add a vimeo video to a product as the first item in the gallery and as the base image.
- Go to that product page in the frontend.
- See the video auto play, and then switch to the next item in the gallery.
